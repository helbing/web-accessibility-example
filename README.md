## ARIA

HTML standard components have good support for Web Accessibilty, but when we develop custom component, how make it support Web Accessibilty. That why we need [ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/). ARIA is an HTML extension that provides a set of HTML attributes to help user can use the screen reader correctly.
